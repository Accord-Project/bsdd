* Abstract
The buildingSmart Data Dictionary (bSDD) is an important shared resource in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO) domain.
It is a collection of datasets ("domains") that define various classifications (objects representing building components, products and materials) and their properties.
bSDD defines a GraphQL API, as well as REST APIs that return JSON and RDF representations.
This improves the interoperability of bSDD and its easier deployment in architectural CAD and other AECO software.

We propose TODO


* Introduction

** bSDD
(Beetz 2014)
"The buildingSMART Data Dictionary (bSDD) (Bell & Bjørkhaug 2006) is a structured vocabulary that currently consists of some 80,000 concepts with translations in multiple languages"


** Benefits of GraphQL

** Original BSDD Schema: GraphQL Voyager
TODO We use the excellent tool GraphQL Voyager that can represent any GraphQL API as an interactive graph.

** GraphQL Conversion to SOML Schema

Major goal of this project is to improve the bSDD GraphQL API.
To achieve this, the existing GraphQL schema will be converted to a [[https://platform.ontotext.com/semantic-objects/soml/index.html][SOML schema]]
which then will be manually improved and finally used to generate a better GraphQL API with the help of [[https://platform.ontotext.com/semantic-objects/][Ontotext Platform]].

The repository contains a Python utility script [[./graphql2soml.py][graphql2soml.py]] that can generate a
[[https://platform.ontotext.com/semantic-objects/soml/index.html][SOML schema]] from given GraphQL endpoint.

Executing this script produces two files in the repository:

- [[./bsdd-graphql-schema-orig.json][bsdd-graphql-schema-orig.json]] - JSON response of the GraphQL introspection
- [[./bsdd-graphql-soml-orig.yaml][bsdd-graphql-soml-orig.yaml]] - SOML schema produced from the introspection

The generated SOML schema is valid and can be used immediately. However, there are issues inherited from the GraphQL schema which are described later.
The purpose of the generated SOML schema is to serve as a starting point (instead of starting from scratch) for resolving the issues and improving the schema.
Once this is done, the resulting schema will be saved in [[./bsdd-graphql-soml-refact.yaml][bsdd-graphql-soml-refact.yaml]].

bSDD returns RDF

(Beetz 2014) "bSDD vocabulary has been transformed into a configurable RDF dataset. On the meta-model level a number of different modeling approaches ranging from OWL to RDFS and SKOS have been implemented to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the respective modeling strategies

(Oraskari 2021)
- Generates specific RDF classes (e.g. ~IfcCableSegment~) and properties (e.g. ~ACResistance~).
  Unlike it, we preserve the original bSDD structure (Domain, Classification, Property, etc) and only add specific improvements
- It fetches bSDD elements on demand, rather than converting all of bSDD at once.

* Suggestions for Improvement

** Improve Property Names
Property names should conform to naming conventions and be spelled consistently
- Property (field) names should be spelled in singular, even when they refer to an array.
  The arity is reflected in the property kind, e.g. in GraphQL that's ~SCALAR~ vs ~ARRAY~.
  For example, ~String~ is a scalar string, whereas ~[String]~ is an array of strings.
- The GraphQL and JSON field ~childs~ should be spelled properly as ~children~ (unless it's spelled in singular, see above)
- RDF properties should conform to the ~lowerCamelCase~ convention, i.e. start with a lowercase letter.
  Most ontologies conform to this convention, eg see the [[https://schema.org/docs/styleguide.html][Schema.org Styleguide]]
- Equivalent properties should be named the same in all cases.
  For example, TODO
- ~namespaceUri~ is a misnomer since "namespace" means a set of URIs sharing the same prefix, but most bSDD URIs are *single* URIs.
  URI is a general term that includes both URNs (non-resolvable) and URLs (resolvable).
  According to Linked Data principles, it is better to use resolvable

** Use the same URL for Data and for Web Pages
bSDD has implemented "entity URLs" i.e. for each kind of entity, it can return its data in JSON or RDF:
#+begin_src
curl -s                      https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT
curl -s -Haccept:text/turtle https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT
#+end_src
Note: to pretty-print the JSON, add this to the end of the command: ~| jq .~

The same URL can be used to get a static web page in the browser:
https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT

[[IFC-class-cableSegment-web.png]]

However, the interactive [[https://search.bsdd.buildingsmart.org][bSDD Search]] UI uses a different URL that returns slightly different information:
https://search.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/Classification/Index/58453

[[IFC-class-cableSegment-search.png]]

Is there need for two different web pages showing nearly the same info?
We think that with some modest change in technology, the Search UI can use the first (semantic) URL directly, instead of an internal (non-semantic) "Index" URL.
Otherwise there is danger that people will start copying these non-semantic URLs in communication, and in AECO data.

** Improve URL Structure and Consistency
- Almost all domain URLs have the same structure: ~https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/<org>/<domain>-<ver>~.
  There are only 2 exceptions:
#+begin_src 
http://otl.amsterdam.nl
http://rdf.vegdata.no/V440/v440-owl
#+end_src

- TODO: org vs domain vs domain version.
  Refer to URL Hackability in LOD Patterns book
  https://patterns.dataincubator.org/book/hierarchical-uris.html
- In some cases the org name doesn't quite mesh with the domain name, perhaps due to the way bSDD allocates org identifiers to bSDD contributors
  - bim-de/DINSPEC91400: the publisher of this spec is DIN (the German standards organization), not the ~bim-de~ initiative
  - digibase/volkerwesselsbv: [[https://www.bimregister.nl/actueel/video/author/89-delanokenepa?start=250][bimregister.nl news from 2018]] suggest that ~digibase~ is a new company/initaitive within Volker Wessel
  - digibase/nen2699: the publisher of this spec is NEN (the Netherlands standards organization), not the ~digibase~ company/initiative
  - digibase/digibasebouwlagen: perhaps the org name ~digibase~ should not be repeated as prefix of the domain ~bouwlagen~ (building layers)
- A few domains use ~http~ whereas all others use ~https~. All modern servers prefer ~https~ due to its better security.
#+begin_src
http://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/spr/spr-cfhios-0.1
http://otl.amsterdam.nl
http://rdf.vegdata.no/V440/v440-owl
#+end_src

** Declare URLs to be ~ID~
TODO: refer to GraphQL recommendation that each node should have ID, and these should be declared as type ~ID~.

Rather than the unwieldy prop name ~namespaceUri~, most GraphQL implementations call this simply ~id~.

** GraphQL Arrays and Nullability
TODO: all of  [Classification], [Classification!], [Classification]!, [Classification!]! are different. Their spec [Classification] allows [null,null,null] as an xanswer

** Return the Same Data Across APIs
We have compared 3 representations returned by the bSDD server:
- JSON from the GraphQL API
- JSON from the REST (entity) API
- RDF  from the REST (entity) API

We obtained a couple of "rich" objects of each class (i.e. objects with maximum fields filled),
and compared the fields in each of the 3 APIs.

There are differences and omissions in some of the formats, as described in the table below.
It would be best to return the same content in each of the formats.


| **Class**/field            | GraphQL      | JSON API                                   | RDF API                | comment                                                                                                  |

|                            |              |                                            |                        |                                                                                                          |

Illustrations of the points above:
- (1) GraphQL field ~childs~ appears when one queries for ~classification (namespaceUri:"...", includeChilds:true)~.
    It includes a list of children classifications but with simple properties only.
#+begin_src json
TODO
#+end_src
- (1) JSON includes the inverse link (from child to parent), e.g. when one fetches the subclass ~IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT~, one gets a parent link to ~IfcCableSegment~
#+begin_src json
// curl -s https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT
{
  "referenceCode": "IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT",
  "parentClassificationReference": {
    "namespaceUri": "https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcCableSegment",
#+end_src
- (2,3) In GraphQL and JSON payload, a ~ClassificationProperty~ does not have a distinct URL, and cannot be obtained separately from the ~Classification~ in which it lives.
  As a consequence, ClassificationProperties are not considered as first-class entities
#+begin_src json
// curl -s https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT
{
  "referenceCode": "IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT",
  "classificationProperties": [
    {
      "name": "ACResistance",
      "propertyCode": "ACResistance",
      "propertyDomainName": "IFC",
      "propertyNamespaceUri": "https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/prop/ACResistance",
#+end_src

- (3) RDF includes the following attribute (string). Instead, it should be a relation (object property), e.g.  ~bsdd:property <prop/ACResistance>~
#+begin_src turtle
@base <https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/>.
<class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT/ACResistance>
  bsdd:PropertyNamespaceUri "https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/prop/ACResistance".
#+end_src

- (4) RDF includes the following relation. The source is a ~ClassificationProperty~ and the target is a ~Classification~, so the relation should be named ~classification~
#+begin_src turtle
@base <https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/>.
<class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT/ACResistance>
  bsdd:ClassificationProperty <class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT>.
#+end_src

** Improve GraphQL Results and Eliminate Errors

As of Dec 2022, the [[https://test.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/graphql/][bSDD Test GraphQL API]] returns the following results.
- TODO Misho: can you access the Production GraphQL secured endpoint: https://api.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/graphqls/ ?
Some of them can be improved as described below.

The GraphQL API returns 90 domains.
The distribution of classifications per domain is as follows:
| from |   to | count | note                                                                                   |

TODO Misho: add more

** Improve Relations Between Objects
BSDD includes numerous string attributes (codes or URLs) that should be converted to relations (object fields) in order to improve the connectedness of the GraphQL graph.
- ~ClassificationRelation~ and ~PropertyRelation~ do not have any outgoing relations, instead they use strings (e.g. ~relatedPropertyUri~), thus blocking further GraphQL navigation
- There are a number of unused classes (~Country, Language, ReferenceDocument, Unit~).
  Instead of relations pointing to these classes, the other classes have strings that represent the same information
Problems related to this approach:
- One cannot easily navigate in the GraphQL graph.
  E.g. to find the country name for ~countriesOfUse: ["BG"]~, one needs to make a second query,
  get all countries, and look for that code.
- It represents data denormalization that creates opportunities for data inconsistency or redundancy,
  e.g. if ~countriesOfUse~ includes a code "XX" that is not defined in ~Country~, is that a mistake, or is ~Country~ just an advisory table?

TODO explain more.


Here is a list of all strings that are candidates to be converted to objects:
- ~countriesOfUse~: array of country code strings, should become array of relations to ~Country~
- ~documentReference~: a string, and it's unclear whether it should be the URL of a ~ReferenceDocument~, a bibliographic reference, a title or some other free text.
  Should become relation to ~ReferenceDocument~
- ~relatedIfcEntityNames~: since IFC is present as a bSDD Domain, could be converted to a relation to the respective IFC Classification

  TODO: PropSet should be made an entoity, it's too important to be a mere string
  
** Property vs ClassificationProperty: Use Distinct URLs
~Property~ and ~ClassificationProperty~ are two different classes, but the latter does not have a distinct URL in GraphQL and JSON.
We can say that the same URL is overloaded to identify entities of both classes.

~ClassificationProperty~ is identified only in RDF since this format forces one to use different identities for different nodes:
#+begin_src turtle
<https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT/ACResistance>
  bsdd:ClassificationProperty <https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT>;
  bsdd:PropertyDomainName "IFC";
  bsdd:PropertyNamespaceUri "https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/prop/ACResistance".
#+end_src

~ClassificationProperty~ are thus "second class" entities and are not returned separately by the JSON or RDF entity API,
but only as part of the respective ~Classification~:
#+begin_src
curl https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT/ACResistance
{"":["Classification with namespace URI
 'https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT/ACResistance'
  not found"]}
#+end_src

** Improve the Description of Local Properties
Perhaps because there is no clearly defined distinction between global properties (~Property~) and local properties (~ClassificationProperty~)
and no rules which attributes are inherited from one to the other,
some local properties are not properly described.
For example, let's look at the local property ~Status~ in classification [[https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcAirTerminalBox][IfcAirTerminalBox]]:

#+begin_src json
      "name": "Status",
      "description": "The status currently assigned to the permit.",
      "propertyCode": "Status",
      "propertyNamespaceUri": "https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/prop/Status",
      "propertySet": "Pset_AirTerminalBoxTypeCommon",
#+end_src

The local definition refers to an appropriate propset ~Pset_AirTerminalBoxTypeCommon~,
but the ~description~ is not appropriate to that classification (an "AirTerminalBox" is not a "permit"!).

** Improve RDF Structure
Overall, bSDD RDF represents the scope of bSDD data faithfully, although there are various omissions.

Also, there are various problems that should be corrected.
E.g. let's take the Turtle (RDF) fragment from the previous section:
#+begin_src turtle
<https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT/ACResistance>
  bsdd:ClassificationProperty <https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT>;
  bsdd:PropertyDomainName "IFC";
  bsdd:PropertyNamespaceUri "https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/prop/ACResistance".
#+end_src

It has these defects:
- No class is defined for the subject
- Prop names should start with lowercase
- String attributes should be converted to relations when applicable
- URLs should be object properties instead of strings

This fragment can be corrected as follows:
#+begin_src turtle
<https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT/ACResistance>
  a bsdd:ClassificationProperty;
  bsdd:classification <https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT>;
  bsdd:domain <https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3>;
  bsdd:property <https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/prop/ACResistance>.
#+end_src


** Use Class Inheritance
The following classes are very similar.
Many of the same fields are copied between them, with no modularity or inheritance:
- ~Property~ and ~ClassificationProperty~: we need to add some sort of relation or inheritance between them
- ~PropertyValue~ and ~ClassificationPropertyValue~: in fact are the same.
  These are "value objects" (simple immutable objecst), so there's absolutely no need to have two different classes

~Property~ is a general property definition, while ~ClassificationProperty~ is a property defined (or modified) locally to a ~Classification~.
TODO

** Add More Classes and Relations
- PropertySet
- DomainVersion
- CountrySubdivision



** Add GraphQL Pagination

** Improve GraphQL Searchability

** Eliminate Parallel Links Between Classes

** Improve Multilingual Support
bSDD accommodates multiple languages, but each domain seems to be present in one language only.

** Deprecated Properties

** Improve the Description of Structured Values

~ClassificationPropertyValue~ are structured values with rich fields: ~code, value, namespaceUri, description, sortNumber~.
These fields allow:
- unique identification of values through ~namespaceUri~
- potentially multilingual translations in the future (if ~value, description~ are made multivalued and attached a language tag)
- logical ordering of values through ~sortNumber~ (as opposed to always alphabetical ordering)
However, all structured values we've seen only ever have ~code, value~ and the other fields are null.

For example, the property ~ArrangementType~ in classification [[https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcAirTerminalBox][IfcAirTerminalBox]] has values described like this:
#+begin_src json
      "code": "DUALDUCT",
      "value": "DUALDUCT"
#+end_src

Value descriptions are intermingled with the property description (newline-separated) like this:
#+begin_src json
      "name": "ArrangementType",
      "description": "Terminal box arrangement.\n\
SingleDuct: Terminal box receives warm or cold air from a single air supply duct.\n\
DualDuct: Terminal box receives warm and cold air from separate air supply ducts.",
#+end_src

The "standard" values (NOTKNOWN, OTHER, UNSET) are not described at all.

Value URLs are missing, precluding unique identification.

** Better Representation of Predefined Values

~allowedValues~ (and its deprecated variant ~possibleValues~) store Structured Values (~ClassificationPropertyValue~).
However, their "sibling" property ~predefinedValue~ holds a mere string and not a Structured Value.
This means that even in the future, ~predefinedValue~ cannot be an enumeration value that is identified globally with a URL.
We could think of two possible reasons for this discrepancy:
- ~predefinedValue~ needs to hold not just enumeration values, but also Real, String, Boolean etc.
  However, then it should be structured as a variant, and not cast down into a String.
- It may be related to the poor description of Structured Values (see the previous section):
