* Abstract
The buildingSmart Data Dictionary (bSDD) is an important shared resource in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO) domain.
It is a collection of datasets ("domains") that define various classifications (objects representing building components, products and materials) and their properties.
bSDD defines a GraphQL API, as well as REST APIs that return JSON and RDF representations.
This improves the interoperability of bSDD and its easier deployment in architectural CAD and other AECO software.

We propose TODO


* Introduction

** bSDD
(Beetz 2014)
"The buildingSMART Data Dictionary (bSDD) (Bell & Bjørkhaug 2006) is a structured vocabulary that currently consists of some 80,000 concepts with translations in multiple languages"


** Benefits of GraphQL

** Original BSDD Schema: GraphQL Voyager
TODO We use the excellent tool GraphQL Voyager that can represent any GraphQL API as an interactive graph.

** GraphQL Conversion to SOML Schema

Major goal of this project is to improve the bSDD GraphQL API.
To achieve this, the existing GraphQL schema will be converted to a [[https://platform.ontotext.com/semantic-objects/soml/index.html][SOML schema]]
which then will be manually improved and finally used to generate a better GraphQL API with the help of [[https://platform.ontotext.com/semantic-objects/][Ontotext Platform]].

The repository contains a Python utility script [[./graphql2soml.py][graphql2soml.py]] that can generate a
[[https://platform.ontotext.com/semantic-objects/soml/index.html][SOML schema]] from given GraphQL endpoint.

Executing this script produces two files in the repository:

- [[./bsdd-graphql-schema-orig.json][bsdd-graphql-schema-orig.json]] - JSON response of the GraphQL introspection
- [[./bsdd-graphql-soml-orig.yaml][bsdd-graphql-soml-orig.yaml]] - SOML schema produced from the introspection

The generated SOML schema is valid and can be used immediately. However, there are issues inherited from the GraphQL schema which are described later.
The purpose of the generated SOML schema is to serve as a starting point (instead of starting from scratch) for resolving the issues and improving the schema.
Once this is done, the resulting schema will be saved in [[./bsdd-graphql-soml-refact.yaml][bsdd-graphql-soml-refact.yaml]].

bSDD returns RDF

(Beetz 2014) "bSDD vocabulary has been transformed into a configurable RDF dataset. On the meta-model level a number of different modeling approaches ranging from OWL to RDFS and SKOS have been implemented to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the respective modeling strategies

(Oraskari 2021)
- Generates specific RDF classes (e.g. ~IfcCableSegment~) and properties (e.g. ~ACResistance~).
  Unlike it, we preserve the original bSDD structure (Domain, Classification, Property, etc) and only add specific improvements
- It fetches bSDD elements on demand, rather than converting all of bSDD at once.

* Suggestions for Improvement

** Improve Property Names
Property names should conform to naming conventions and be spelled consistently
- Property (field) names should be spelled in singular, even when they refer to an array.
  The arity is reflected in the property kind, e.g. in GraphQL that's ~SCALAR~ vs ~ARRAY~.
  For example, ~String~ is a scalar string, whereas ~[String]~ is an array of strings.
- The GraphQL and JSON field ~childs~ should be spelled properly as ~children~ (unless it's spelled in singular, see above)
- RDF properties should conform to the ~lowerCamelCase~ convention, i.e. start with a lowercase letter
- Equivalent properties should
- ~namespaceUri~ is a misnomer since "namespace" means a set of URIs sharing the same prefix, but most BSDD URIs are *single* URIs.
  URI is a general term that includes both URNs (non-resolvable) and URLs (resolvable).
  According to Linked Data principles, it is better to use resolvable
  
** Use the same URL for Data and for Web Pages
bSDD has implemented "entity URLs" i.e. for each kind of entity, it can return its data in JSON or RDF:
#+begin_src 
curl -s                      https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT
curl -s -Haccept:text/turtle https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT
#+end_src
Note: to pretty-print the JSON, add this to the end of the command: ~| jq .~

The same URL can be used to get a static web page in the browser:
https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT

[[IFC-class-cableSegment-web.png]]

However, the interactive [[https://search.bsdd.buildingsmart.org][bSDD Search]] UI uses a different URL that returns slightly different information:
https://search.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/Classification/Index/58453

[[IFC-class-cableSegment-search.png]]

Is there need for two different web pages showing nearly the same info?
We think that with some modest change in technology, the Search UI can use the first (semantic) URL directly, instead of an internal (non-semantic) "Index" URL.
Otherwise there is danger that people will start copying these non-semantic URLs in communication, and in AECO data.

** Improve URL Structure and Consistency

** Return the Same Data Across APIs
We have compared 3 representations returned by the bSDD server:
- JSON from the GraphQL API
- JSON from the REST (entity) API
- RDF  from the REST (entity) API

We obtained a couple of "rich" objects of each class (i.e. objects with maximum fields filled),
and compared the fields in each of the 3 APIs.

There are differences and omissions in some of the formats, as described in the table below.
It would be best to return the same content in each of the formats.


| **Class**/field            | GraphQL      | JSON API                                   | RDF API                | comment                                                                                                  |
|----------------------------+--------------+--------------------------------------------+------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Classification**         |              |                                            |                        |                                                                                                          |

| **ClassificationProperty** |              |                                            |                        | GraphQL and JSON overload the URL and use it for both ClassificationProperty and Property (2)            |

|                            |              |                                            |                        |                                                                                                          |

Illustrations of the points above:
- (1) GraphQL field ~childs~ appears when one queries for ~classification (namespaceUri:"...", includeChilds:true)~.
    It includes a list of children classifications but with simple properties only.
#+begin_src json
TODO
#+end_src
- (1) JSON includes the inverse link (from child to parent), e.g. when one fetches the subclass ~IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT~, one gets a parent link to ~IfcCableSegment~
#+begin_src json
// curl -s https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT
{
  "referenceCode": "IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT",
  "parentClassificationReference": {
    "namespaceUri": "https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcCableSegment",
#+end_src  
- (2,3) In GraphQL and JSON payload, a ~ClassificationProperty~ does not have a distinct URL, and cannot be obtained separately from the ~Classification~ in which it lives.
  As a consequence, ClassificationProperties are not considered as first-class entities
#+begin_src json
// curl -s https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT
{
  "referenceCode": "IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT",
  "classificationProperties": [
    {
      "name": "ACResistance",
      "propertyCode": "ACResistance",
      "propertyDomainName": "IFC",
      "propertyNamespaceUri": "https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/prop/ACResistance",
#+end_src  

- (3) RDF includes the following attribute (string). Instead, it should be a relation (object property), e.g.  ~bsdd:property <prop/ACResistance>~
#+begin_src turtle
@base <https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/>.        
<class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT/ACResistance>
  bsdd:PropertyNamespaceUri "https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/prop/ACResistance".
#+end_src

- (4) RDF includes the following relation. The source is a ~ClassificationProperty~ and the target is a ~Classification~, so the relation should be named ~classification~
#+begin_src turtle
@base <https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/>.        
<class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT/ACResistance>
  bsdd:ClassificationProperty <class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT>.
#+end_src

** Improve Relations Between Objects
BSDD includes numerous string attributes (codes or URLs) that should be converted to relations (object fields) in order to improve the connectedness of the GraphQL graph.
TODO explain more.

Here is a list of all strings that are candidates to be converted to objects:
- 
- relatedIfcEntityNames: since IFC is present as a BSDD Domain, could be converted to a link to the respective IFC Classification

** Property vs ClassificationProperty: Use Distinct URLs
ClassificationProperty is defined as a class, but it does not have a distinct URL in GraphQL and JSON (only in RDF).

#+begin_src turtle
<https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT/ACResistance>
  bsdd:ClassificationProperty <https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT>;
  bsdd:PropertyDomainName "IFC";
  bsdd:PropertyNamespaceUri "https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/prop/ACResistance".
#+end_src

Also, it is not returned by the JSON or RDF entity API:
#+begin_src 
curl https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT/ACResistance
{"":["Classification with namespace URI
 'https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT/ACResistance'
  not found"]}
#+end_src

** Improve RDF Structure
Overall, bSDD RDF represents the scope of bSDD data faithfully, although there are various omissions.

Also, there are various problems that should be corrected.
E.g. let's take the Turtle (RDF) fragment from the previous section:
#+begin_src turtle
<https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT/ACResistance>
  bsdd:ClassificationProperty <https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT>;
  bsdd:PropertyDomainName "IFC";
  bsdd:PropertyNamespaceUri "https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/prop/ACResistance".
#+end_src

It has these defects:
- No class is defined for the subject
- Prop names should start with lowercase
- String attributes should be converted to relations when applicable
- URLs should be object properties instead of strings

This fragment can be corrected as follows:
#+begin_src turtle
<https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT/ACResistance>
  a bsdd:ClassificationProperty;
  bsdd:classification <https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/class/IfcCableSegmentCABLESEGMENT>;
  bsdd:domain <https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3>;
  bsdd:property <https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/buildingsmart/ifc-4.3/prop/ACResistance>.
#+end_src


** Use Class Inheritance
- Property vs ClassificationProperty
- PropertyValue vs ClassificationPropertyValue

** Add More Classes and Relations
- PropertySet
- DomainVersion
- CountrySubdivision



** Add GraphQL Pagination

** Improve GraphQL Searchability

** Eliminate Parallel Links Between Classes

** Improve Multilingual Support
bSDD accommodates multiple languages, but each domain seems to be present in one language only.

** Deprecated Properties
