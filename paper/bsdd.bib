  abstract = {Currently, only a limited number of dedicated data models for infrastructural artefacts exist. To cover information exchange and interoperability requirements, a number of international initiatives have been started under the umbrella of the buildingSMART organization to extend the predominant IFC model. In this paper, we are introducing a light-weight approach that allows the flexible extension of the IFC model with RDF vocabularies and ontologies. Using real-world quay wall models from the port of Rotterdam we show how information from multiple networked data sources can be seamlessly integrated with IFC models as the main carrier of geometric representation. We demonstrate how these semantically enriched models can be used with unmodified legacy software systems to facilitate a number of interoperability scenarios throughout different lifecycle phases.},

The bSDD allows linking between all the content inside the database. It provides a standardized workflow to guarantee data quality and information consistency. BIM modelers use the bSDD to have easy and efficient access to all kinds of standards to enrich their model. BIM Managers use the bSDD to check BIM data for validity. Advanced users use the contents from the bSDD to check compliance, automatically find manufactures products, extend IFC, create Information Delivery Specifications (IDS) and much more. Besides national classification systems (Uniclass, Minnd, etc) and application specific standards (ETIM, UniversalTypes, IfcAirport, etc) project specific, National and company specific standards can be stored in bSDD as well. The internal structure can facilitate ISO 12006-3, ISO 23386 and Linked Data publications.},

  abstract = {Building Information Modeling is a topic widely discussed in construction research today. It is a concept that potentially could benefit the construction industry in several different ways. Many believe that BIM will revolutionize the industry in the future. The buildingSMART data dictionary (bsDD) is an international standard developed by the neutral organization buildingSMART. It is a standard that defines the terminology surrounding BIM objects. Much research has been done on the potential benefits of BIM in general. However, no research has been made on the immediate consequences of an implementation of the buildingSMART data dictionary. The purpose of this thesis is to determine how a property development and construction company, that already works with BIM in many of its projects, would be affected by an implementation of the bsDD. The possible consequences of bsDD implementation are mapped out and analyzed through a literature review. In addition to this, a simulation is conducted with the purpose of showing how object libraries can be created on an organizational level. The findings of this thesis show that the consequences of a bsDD implementation can be summarized into three categories; technological, operational, and contractual consequences. The main consequences of the implementation would be that the employees would have to be provided education and continual support, through guidelines and internal BIM standards etc. The consequence with the largest impact, however, would be the task of creating an object library. This task is required since the bsDD does not have any Swedish content yet.},

IFD, or the buildingSMART ontology, brings us one step closer to 100\% standardization of the information, and will together with the IDM initiative and IFCs allow an efficient building information exchange. This paper demonstrates how the IFD standard is able to standardize the information in a language agnostic way, and provide the whole building process with new possibilities within the area of product information exchange, knowledge systems, and life-cycle analysis. We will also describe our technical solution to the challenge and refer to the actual implementation of the solution, running on the internet today.},

  abstract = {As building information modeling (BIM) gains popularity in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, manufacturers are required to distribute their product specifications in digital product models. Currently, manufacturers mainly employ proprietary formats, such as BIM objects supplemented by PDF documents to represent their product data descriptions. However, these formats do not support flexible automated product search and data integration. This paper describes the use of Semantic Web technologies in combination with BIM-based visual programming language (VPL) to automatically integrate product data from external databases. To facilitate data integration, we introduced a method to semantically represent product data linked with the CEN/TS 17623:2021 standard using ontologies in web ontology language (OWL). The study has focused on the use case of a manufacturer of lighting products. Results show that building designers are able to execute a more efficient product search that satisfies their query requirements and returns suitable products of their choice from the manufacturer's database based on their requests. This approach eliminates the time-consuming and error-prone process of manually entering product data into BIM software.},

Linked Building Data is widely used in research projects and actively advances by the researchers in the World Wide Web Consortium Linked Building Data Community Group. buildingSMART is a worldwide organization that develops standards to enable collaboration and digital BIM workflows. The buildingSMART Data Dictionary (bSDD) is an international standard that defines a hierarchically structured encyclopedia of object concepts and their properties used in building information models. It is provided as is an online service. While there have been earlier work where data exports of bSDD have been expressed as the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and used in linked data, a consistent approach for keeping them automatically up to date has been missing. In this work, I study how to publish the buildingSMART Data Dictionary classifications and terms as a web ontology, use them in the Linked Building Data context, and keep the data in sync with the buildingSMART Data Dictionary primary data. I present an online ontology generator that ad-hoc provides up-to-date ontology descriptions of concepts in the buildingSMART database.The earlier work is presented in this work, and the feasibility of the online live updates for the ontologies that reflect the bSDD database data is shown. The results are reflected and compared with the earlier work. This paper summarizes ways to publish the bSDD vocabularies as linked data in a sustainable way.},

Large number of product types, national codes, classification systems; and the need to support multiple languages, cause construction industry supply chains to be more fragmented than in manufacturing industry. Product libraries entail some essential information contents, which have been recognized as: identification, classification, composition and performance. Product data significance is found from its availability through the life cycle of the building. The life cycle availability point of view is emphasized in product library applications and software interoperability. Software has to be able to identify the terms of product comparability within searches and data exchange, and instance them into software objects. To enable the software vendors and product manufacturers to output interoperable data, BIM based procedures require commonly agreed information exchange methods},
